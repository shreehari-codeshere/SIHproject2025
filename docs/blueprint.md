# **App Name**: AgriAssist AI

## Core Features:

- Data Integration: Aggregates satellite imagery, IoT sensor feeds, weather data, market prices, and user inputs. Provides a comprehensive and continuously updated dataset for accurate land and crop analysis.
- Crop Recommendation Engine: Employs a trained machine learning model to evaluate integrated data. Generates a ranked list of recommended crops based on expected yield, potential profitability, and sustainability metrics (water usage, soil health, crop rotation benefits).
- AI Chatbot Support: Multilingual, voice + text-enabled chatbot. Farmers can ask domain-specific questions, receive instant, context-aware responses, and upload crop images for AI-powered disease/pest diagnosis. Functions as a problem-solving assistant rather than just a Q&A bot.
- Dashboard: Central hub with an intuitive, card-based interface. Displays real-time soil health data, localized weather updates, and active crop recommendations. Designed for clarity and quick decision-making.
- Recommendation Breakdown: Highlights the top three recommended crops. Provides a detailed resource profile for each crop, including required inputs (water, fertilizer, labor), projected yield (with confidence intervals), and profitability estimates (short-term and seasonal).
- Offline Capability: Stores critical data in local storage for offline use. Ensures uninterrupted access to recommendations, best-practice guides, and pre-downloaded content. Syncs seamlessly with the cloud when connectivity is restored.
- Yield & Profit Forecasting: Offers visual forecasting tools. Graphs show predicted yield and profit trends for selected crops. Helps farmers make data-driven, long-term planning decisions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Clean, card-based layout → information in digestible, visual blocks.
- ‘PT Sans’ for both body and headlines → modern, readable, and farmer-friendly.
- Use clear, descriptive icons (soil, water, sun, pest, yield) for quick recognition.
- Subtle transitions to confirm user actions and improve user experience without distraction.
- Primary color: Earthy green (#6B8E23), symbolizing growth and nature.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), creating a neutral and calming backdrop.
- Accent color: Warm brown (#A0522D), for highlighting important information and calls to action.
